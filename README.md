# Eco Mode: theme switcher and preferences advice
Eco Mode is a repo of code snippets and assets to support light/dark/eco mode support. With sustainable and efficient SVGs, JS, HTML, CSS snippets, and implementation advice (as comments in the suggested CSS, mainly).

## Suggested implementations only
What works for your site will vary. But I figured it would help to share some simplified versions right here.

### Example implementations
* [My website, codeword: creative](https://codewordcreative.com)
* [Client website, Crossing Borders: Translating Turkish](https://translatingturkish.com)

#### Less mature, single-page examples
[Susty Icons CSS Playground](https://codewordcreative.com/susty-icons-css-playground/)

[Susty Icons preview variants page](https://codewordcreative.github.io/susty-icons/preview-variants.html)

More to follow soon, I hope!

Thanks also to Nick Lewis for inspiring me with mad use of variables, and to various members of the W3C Sustainable Web Interest Group for bouncing ideas around about Eco mode, especially Tantek, Hidde, and Alex.
